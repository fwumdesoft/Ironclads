Alex Berman and Ryan Goldstein present...
The Battle of Hampton Roads.
A video game.
It is March 9, 1864.
You are near Southeastern Virginia, close to a town called Hampton Roads.
You have been serving on the CSS Monitor.
Yesterday, you engaged the Union blockade.
Using your ram, you sunk the USS Cumberland by ramming it.
You nearly sunk, and lost your ram in the process.
The USS Congress tried to flee your ram by running aground.
This made it a prime target for your cannons.
During the engagement, Captain Buchanan was killed.
Now, you are the captain.
The USS Minnesota ran aground during the battle.
Reports of a new Union ship have reached you.
Your cannons will make short work of it.
Your goal is to finish the battle and break the blockade.
