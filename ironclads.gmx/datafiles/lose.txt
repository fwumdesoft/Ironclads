That is not how the battle ended at all! 
(You probably shouldn't have rammed into that.)
After the USS Monitor (the union ship you were fighting) withdrew, the CSS Virginia thought they had won and began to leave. 
When the Monitor moved back into a fighting position, it thought the Virginia was running away. 
Both sides thought they’d won the battle.
In fact, the ending to the Battle of Hampton roads is an anti climax- it was a complete draw.
Thank you for playing.
